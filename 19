Launch a container name Abathur. It will be a Python container, 2-slim version,
its /root folder will be bound to a HOME folder on your host, and its 3000 port
will be bound to the 3000 port of your virtual machine.

You will personalize this container so that you can use the Flask micro-framework
in its latest version. You will make sure that an html page displaying "Hello World"
with <h1> tags can be served by Flask.
